// Sometimes it makes sense to have a item before the root of the view-controller,
// such as settings. You configure a "previous" item for the root controller to support this.

// Install navigation item before view-controller itself, and when picking this the view-hierarchy
// is rolled back to this view-controller (that must be hierarchy root) and the action block is called.
// You remove any previous entry if either title or block is nil.

// but can be used to check by outside parties to check if something has already been configured
// in which case it returns non-nil.
